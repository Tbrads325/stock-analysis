# VBA Module 2 Challenge Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
After writing the stock analysis VBA script for Steve we were then charged with refactoring the code
to run the analysis faster moving forward. 

## Results

### 2017 old

### 2017 new

As shown above once the new refactored code was run the analysis was performed much faster. 

### 2018 old

### 2018 new

The same can be said about the 2018 analysis as well. Thus, both years' analysis was performed faster with the newly
refactored code.
 
## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

There are multiple advantages that came with refactoring the code. Foremost, the analysis now runs faster than before. Additionally,
the analysis also does more in a shorter amount of time. Not only does the refactored code perform the regular analysis, but it also performs
the formatting of the cells after the analysis. Previously there was a seperate macro that had been written for formatting the cells following
the initial analysis of the stocks. However, refactoring code does occasionally, come with the risk of creating/introducing bugs into the code 
that already performs as intended. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

As a result, compared to the original VBA script this new refactored code is now more efficient and easier to follow than before. Moreover,
in the future it will be easier to make changes to this code. When refactoring the code there were no problems when in came 
to introducing new bugs into the script and therefore we avoided one of the disadvantages of refactoring code.
